FindItHere: Campus Lost & Found Portal
A centralized digital solution for managing lost and found items at IIT Jodhpur using modern web technologies.

by Mangalton Okram, Nishant Chourasia Under the guidance of Prof. Sumit Kalra

🚀 Features
This portal is built with a complete MERN stack and includes robust features for users, and a full approval system for admins.

👤 User & Authentication
Secure Signup: New user registration with real email OTP verification (using Nodemailer).

JWT Authentication: Secure login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with 5-hour expiration.

Password Hashing: Passwords are never saved as plain text; they are hashed using bcryptjs.

Dynamic Navbar: The navigation bar intelligently changes, showing "Login/Signup" to guests and "My Reports/Logout" to logged-in users.

"My Reports" Page: A private page where users can track the status (Pending/Approved) of all items they have personally reported.

📦 Item & Reporting
Report Items: Logged-in users can report lost or found items through a dedicated, protected form.

Image Upload: Users can (optionally) upload an image of the item (multer for file handling).

View All Items: A central page to view all Approved items.

Search & Filter: Users can instantly search the "View All" list by name/description or filter by category (e.g., 'Electronics') and type ('Lost'/'Found').

Smart "Claim" Button: The 'View' page shows a different button and instructions depending on whether an item is 'Lost' or 'Found'.

👑 Admin Panel & Security
Role-Based Access: The system differentiates between student and admin roles.

Admin-Only Panel: A secure /admin route, protected by middleware, is only visible and accessible to admin users.

Approval System: Admins can view a list of all "Pending" items and click "Approve" to make them public.

Auto-Approval: Items reported by an admin are automatically approved to save time.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, React Router, Axios, jwt-decode

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB Atlas (connected with Mongoose)

Key Backend Packages:

jsonwebtoken & bcryptjs: For authentication & security.

nodemailer: For sending real email OTPs.

multer: For handling image file uploads.

cors, dotenv: For server configuration and security.

🏁 Getting Started
To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend server and the frontend client.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)

NPM

A free MongoDB Atlas account

A Gmail account with a generated "App Password" (for nodemailer).

1. Backend Setup
Clone the repository (or use your folder)

Navigate to the backend folder:

Bash

cd backend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder. This is the most important step. Paste the following and fill in your details:

Code snippet

# MongoDB Atlas Connection String
mongoURI=mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster...

# Nodemailer (Gmail) Credentials
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-digit-app-password

# JWT Secret (Make this a long, random string)
JWT_SECRET=MY_PROJECT_IS_SECRET_12345
Update index.js and middleware/auth.js:

Find the line jwt.sign(...) in index.js and auth.js.

Replace the hardcoded secret 'my-jwt-secret-key-12345' with process.env.JWT_SECRET. This is much more secure.

Start the server:

Bash

npm start
The server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

2. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal.

Navigate to the campus-lost-and-found (frontend) folder:

Bash

cd campus-lost-and-found
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Start the client:

Bash

npm start
The React app will open on http://localhost:3000.

You can now use the fully functional application!
